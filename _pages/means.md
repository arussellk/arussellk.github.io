# Arithmetic, Geometric, and Harmonic means

For an arithmetic mean, find $a$ such that:
$$
x_1+x_2+...+x_n = a+a+...+a
$$
For a geometric mean, find $g$ such that:
$$
x_1 \times x_2 \times \cdots \times x_n = g \times g \times \cdots \times g
$$
For a harmonic mean, find $h$ such that:
$$
\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{x_n}=\frac{1}{h}+\frac{1}{h}+\cdots+\frac{1}{h}
$$
