- (optional) 1 package cream cheese
- seasonings: salt, black pepper, herbs (rosemary, thyme, generic italian),
  garlic powder, onion powder, paprika (small amount), chili powder (small
  amount)

  seasonings instead

Directions:
1. Dice and saute onion in large soup pot
2. Add cubed and peeled squash and cook for a few minutes
3. Add stock or water until covered
4. Add tomato, seasonings, and bay leaf
5. Cover and simmer on low for 30-45 mins (the squash should be soft when done)

   the end)
