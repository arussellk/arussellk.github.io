title: Time handling for purchase transactions

Advice commonly found on the internet for how to program with timezones is some
version of:
1. Only store UTC datetimes in your database. (e.g.,
   `2022-01-08T10:45:00.000Z`.)
2. Convert the UTC datetime to the user's timezone for display. (e.g.,
   `2022-01-08T10:45:00.000Z -> 2022-01-08T03:45:00-07:00`.)

This advice is good for keeping track of a single point in time (e.g., when
does the meeting start), but sometimes working with timezones is slightly more
complicated.
The purpose of this post is to explain a situation that I encountered where it
took some extra effort to convert the UTC datetime from the database to the
appropriate timezone for display.

This post uses
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
and
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
for code example.
You can go to
[Moment.js Timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/)
and open your developer console to execute and experiment with the examples
yourself.

# Background

I worked on a system that showed users their bank account transaction
history. Users could grant access to their transaction history via OAuth,
allowing our system to read their transactions and display them in a nice way.
One day I received a bug report that the transaction date shown in our system
did not match the date the user expected. I looked at the code responsible for
getting the date from the bank's API and found that the previous author did not
consider timezones in their implementation. The existing code looked like this:

```
// txn is loaded from the API
const txn = {
  utcDateTime: '2022-04-30T23:01:00.000Z',
  // ...
};

const txnDate = txn.utcDateTime.slice(0, 'YYYY-MM-DD'.length);
console.log(txnDate); // '2022-04-30'
```

The bug report said that this date should actually be `2022-05-01`.
I checked which bank API this transaction came from, and it was a bank located
in GB. The problem is that the existing code does not consider timezones, and
the solution is to interpret the txn's utcDateTime in the timezone that the
txn took place.

# What went wrong?

Before we fix the problem, let's look at how this code worked well enough that
that previous author did not immediately notice the problem.
Most of the users of this system were located in US and GB.
This means that as long as a transaction occurs _late_ enough in a day in GB
such that representing it in UTC still appears in the same date, the simple
`.slice` works (i.e., after 1am or so while GB uses BST).
On the other side of things, as long as a transaction occurs _early_ enough in
a day in the US such that represending it in UTC still appears in the same
date, the simple `.slice` works (i.e., before 8pm on the East Coast).

Examples:

| Date                          | Date in UTC              | `.slice`   | `.slice` correct? |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 2022-04-30T12:34:56.789-04:00 | 2022-04-30T16:34:56.789Z | 2022-04-30 | yes               |
| 2022-04-30T20:34:56.789-04:00 | 2022-05-01T00:34:56.789Z | 2022-05-01 | no                |
| 2022-05-01T00:01:00.000+01:00 | 2022-04-30T23:01:00.000Z | 2022-04-30 | no                |
| 2022-05-01T01:01:00.000+01:00 | 2022-05-01T00:01:00.000Z | 2022-05-01 | yes               |

When a person sees a list of transactions and corresponding dates, they expect
to see the date they were experiencing when the payment occurred, not the date
of that instant in time represented in UTC.

# What is the solution?

I have shown that the first ten characters of a UTC datetime string does not
always match the transaction date.
To always interpret a transaction's utcDateTime in the correct zone, I need to
know in what timezone the transaction happened.
Fortunately, the API I was reading from included a country code for each
transaction, allowing me to fix the reported bug for the user in GB:

```
// txn is loaded from the API
const txn = {
  utcDateTime: '2022-04-30T23:01:00.000Z',
  country: 'GB',
  // ...
};

const zones = moment.tz.zonesForCountry('GB'); // ['Europe/London']
const zone = zones[0];

const txnDate = moment(txn.utcDateTime).tz(zone).format('YYYY-MM-DD');
console.log(txnDate); // 2022-05-01
```

Knowing the country where the transaction took place is enough information for
countries which only have one timezone.
Since the bank that sent this data response is based in GB,
including just the country in the
API response is sufficient for many of their users.

# What about transactions in the US?

Suppose someone makes a purchase late one evening in Denver, CO, USA.

```
// txn is loaded from the API
const txn = {
  utcDateTime: '2022-05-01T05:34:56.789Z', // equivalent to 2022-04-30T23:34:56-06:00
  country: 'US',
  // ...
};

const zones = moment.tz.zonesForCountry('US'); // (29)Â ['America/Adak', ..., 'Pacific/Honolulu']
const zone = zones[0]; // This is not always correct. :(

moment.tz.zonesForCountry('US').map(z => {
    const m = moment('2022-05-01T05:34:56.789Z').tz(z);
    return `${m.format('YYYY-MM-DD')} in ${z} (${m.format('Z z')})`;
});

The list above includes both 2022-05-01 and 2022-04-30, which demonstrates that
it is not possible to always know a transaction date given the utcDateTime of a
transaction that takes place in a country with more than one timezone.

I checked the API documentation. The API only tells the _country_ in which the
transaction took place, not the _timezone_ in which the transaction took place.
To fix the bug reported by this user, I manually investigated utcDateTimes
given by this bank's API and concluded that this bank likely mapped the
`'America/New_York'` timezone to the `'US'` country code. I adjusted the code
to account for this case, shipped the change, and have not received bug reports
of incorrect transaction dates since.

Word of advice: if you ever design an API for transactions, please include the
timezone in which the transaction took place, not just the country.
